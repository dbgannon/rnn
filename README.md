# rnn
This contains the code and some model data for the rnn blog.
There are two sets of files here.   The first set is for the cntk lstm example.   it contains

rnn-experiments-for-github.ipynb -- a ipython notebook that explores the embedding space and its properties.

rnn-lstm-for-github.ipynb -- an ipython notebook that demonstrates the financial news halucinator.

The model data is stored in oneDrive.   Here is a link http://1drv.ms/1SmzzB2   (it is 50MB so too big to upload to github.)

The second set of files relate to the tensowflow french translator example.
